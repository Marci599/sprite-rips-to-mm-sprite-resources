If you don't want to download the 25 MB .exe, use the python files from the source code.

Structure your files as follows:
```
<Name>
├─ sprite_rips_to_mm_sprite_resources.exe
├─ <SubjectName>
│  └─ raw
│     ├─ <AnimationName>
│     │  ├─ frame001.png
│     │  └─ frame002.png
│     ├─ <AnimationName>
│     └─ <AnimationName>
├─ <SubjectName>
└─ <SubjectName>
```

After setup, launch the program, select a subject, configure options, and use 'Save & Generate' to create the spritesheetresources into <SubjectName>/generated.

For best results, if your subject moves around in the raw recording and you want to resize it, adjust each frame so it appears stationary before generating the spritesheet.
